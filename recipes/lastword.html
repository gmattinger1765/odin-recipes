    <h1>The Last Word</h1>
    <img src="../images/lastword.webp" width='300' alt="Last Word Cocktail Image">

    <p>The Last Word was first served at the Detroit Athletic Club, circa 1915.
       Created just before the start of Prohibition, it’s one of the cocktail canon’s most successful Prohibition-era drinks.</p>
    <p>The Last Word is about as close to perfect as cocktails can be.
       But like with many classics, creative bartenders have found ways to create variations on the Last Word.
       The Paper Plane, invented in 2008, is a liberal take on the original that features bourbon.
       Other variations hew more closely to the classic recipe, but sub gin for another base spirit.
       Mezcal makes an earthy, savory version, while rhum agricole produces a fresh and grassy drink.

    <p>"The Manhattan was the most famous cocktail in the world shortly after it was invented in New York City’s Manhattan Club,
        some time around 1880."</p>

        Rye's spicier, edgier profile makes it a better choice in this cocktail than bourbon, but really, you can go with whichever you prefer.
        And while Angostura bitters are a must in any variation, a single dash of orange bitters helps brighten the cocktail’s edges,
        bringing the whiskey and vermouth together seamlessly, while the brandied cherry garnish lends a touch of sweetness.
